# Jline

## Introduction

JLine is a Java library for handling console input. It is similar in functionality to [BSD editline](http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/) and [GNU readline](http://www.gnu.org/s/readline/) but with additional features that bring it in par with [ZSH line editor](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html).

People familiar with the readline/editline capabilities for modern shells (such as bash, tcsh or zsh) will find most of the command editing features of JLine to be familiar.

## Brief history

JLine was created by Marc Prud'hommeaux in 2002.

JLine 2 was started by Jason Dillon in 2009 as an evolution of JLine 1.

JLine 3 was started by Guillaume Nodet in 2015 as an evolution of JLine 2.
