    <h1>JLine</h1>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			JLine is a Java library for handling console input. 
			It is similar in functionality to <a href="http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/">BSD editline</a> 
			and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/readline/">GNU readline</a>. but with additional features 
			that bring it in par with <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html">ZSH line editor</a>. 
			People familiar with the readline/editline capabilities for modern shells 
			(such as bash, tcsh or zsh) will find most of the command editing features 
			of JLine to be familiar.
